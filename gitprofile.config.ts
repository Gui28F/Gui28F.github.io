      description: `Investigating how natural language can drive multimodal generative models to produce not just single images, but coherent sequences of visuals that capture narrative flow and contextual consistency.
      For my Master’s thesis, in collaboration with a research team at Google, I explore how to transform natural text into structured representations that diffusion-based models such as LDMs and DiTs can interpret. I also adapt NLP-inspired decoding strategies to guide generation across multiple frames, ensuring continuity and coherence.
      The approach is tested across domains such as DIYs, Recipes, and Visual Storytelling, evaluated using human annotations and automatic metrics based on CLIP and DINO, as well as LLM-based judges.
      My research aims to advance multimodal AI systems that connect language and vision in richer, context-aware ways, enabling applications in creative media, education, prototyping, and interactive systems.`,

       description:
        'While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from text prompts, they struggle with visual consistency when generating image sequences. Existing methods generate each image independently, leading to disjointed narratives - a challenge further exacerbated in non-linear storytelling, where scenes must connect beyond adjacent images. We introduce a novel beam search strategy for latent space exploration, enabling conditional generation of full image sequences with beam search decoding. In contrast to earlier methods that rely on fixed latent priors, our method dynamically samples past latents to search for an optimal sequence of latent representations, ensuring coherent visual transitions. As the latent denoising space is explored, the beam search graph is pruned with a cross-attention mechanism that efficiently scores search paths, prioritizing alignment with both textual prompts and visual context. Human and automatic evaluations confirm that BeamDiffusion outperforms other baseline methods, producing full sequences with superior coherence, visual continuity, and textual alignment.',
